# Welcome! Let's Build Amazing Things Together

You're about to discover something incredible: **you can build websites, apps, and software without knowing how to code.**

This course will teach you how to use AI to build anything you can imagine—using just your words.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll master three simple skills:

1. **Asking the right questions** — How to communicate clearly with the AI
2. **Showing what you want** — Using screenshots to guide the AI
3. **Fixing problems** — Pasting errors so the AI can solve them

That's it. With these three skills, you can build almost anything.

## No Coding Required

Let's be crystal clear: **you don't need to understand code.**

You don't need to know what JavaScript, React, or HTML means. You don't need to memorize anything technical. The AI handles all of that.

Your job is to be the director. You decide what gets built. The AI does the building.

<tip>
Think of this like having a skilled developer working for you 24/7. You tell them what you want, they build it. You don't need to know how to build it yourself.
</tip>

## Two Tools, Unlimited Possibilities

In the next lesson, we'll set up two tools:

1. **Cursor** — The AI-powered app where you'll build everything
2. **DeepFlo.App** — A voice tool that lets you talk instead of type (4-5x faster!)

Don't worry—both are free to start and take just minutes to set up.

## Ready to Begin?

# Setting Up Cursor & DeepFlo.App

Let's get your building tools ready. This will only take a few minutes.

## Part 1: Download Cursor

Cursor is where all the magic happens. It's a free application that runs on your computer.

### Step 1: Go to the Cursor Website
Open your web browser and visit: **cursor.com**

### Step 2: Download Cursor
Click the download button. It will automatically detect if you're on Mac or Windows.

### Step 3: Install Cursor
- **On Mac:** Open the downloaded file and drag Cursor to your Applications folder
- **On Windows:** Run the installer and follow the prompts

### Step 4: Open Cursor
Launch Cursor from your Applications (Mac) or Start Menu (Windows).

<tip>
When Cursor opens for the first time, it may ask you to sign in or create an account. Just follow the prompts—it's quick and free.
</tip>

## Don't Be Scared by What You See!

When Cursor opens, you might think: "Whoa, this looks complicated!"

**That's totally normal.** It looks like a developer's workspace because that's what it is. But here's the secret:

**You can ignore 95% of what you see.**

All those panels, menus, and buttons? You don't need them. We're only going to use one thing: the Composer (the AI chat).

Think of it like a car dashboard. There are lots of buttons and gauges, but to drive, you really just need the steering wheel and pedals. Same idea here.

<warning>
If you see things you don't understand—weird file names, code, technical terms—just ignore them. They're not for you. Focus only on the Composer.
</warning>

## Part 2: Download DeepFlo.App

DeepFlo.App is a voice-to-text tool that will make you 4-5x faster at building. Instead of typing your instructions, you just talk.

### Why Voice-to-Text?

When you speak your ideas instead of typing:
- You're naturally more descriptive
- You can communicate complex ideas faster
- Your prompts sound more natural and conversational
- You build momentum and flow

### Step 1: Go to DeepFlo.App
Open your browser and visit: **deepflo.app**

### Step 2: Download the App
Click the download button for your operating system (Mac or Windows).

### Step 3: Install & Grant Permission
- Run the installer
- When it asks for microphone permission, click **Allow**
- That's it—you're ready!

<tip>
Setup takes about 60 seconds. DeepFlo.App runs quietly in the background until you need it.
</tip>

### Step 4: Test It Out
Once installed, try activating DeepFlo.App and say: "Hello, this is a test."

You should see your words appear as text. If it works, you're all set!

## You're Ready to Build

With Cursor and DeepFlo.App installed, you have everything you need:

- **Cursor** — Your AI building partner
- **DeepFlo.App** — Your voice-to-text superpower

In the next lesson, we'll open Cursor and understand what we're looking at (without getting overwhelmed).

# Understanding Cursor (Without the Overwhelm)

Let's take a calm, simple tour of Cursor. Remember: you only need to know about 5% of what you see.

## Opening Cursor

When you open Cursor, you'll see a workspace that might look intimidating. Let's demystify it.

## The Only Things You Need to Know

### 1. The File Area (Left Side)
This shows your project files—like folders on your computer. You might see file names that look like gibberish (index.html, App.jsx, etc.). 

**You don't need to understand these.** The AI creates and manages them for you.

### 2. The Main Area (Center)
This is where code appears. Again, you don't need to read or understand it. It's just the AI's work—like watching a chef cook in a kitchen. You don't need to know the recipe.

### 3. The Composer (The Important Part!)
This is your conversation with the AI. You can open it by:
- Looking for a chat icon
- Clicking on the AI/Composer panel

**This is where you'll spend 99% of your time.** Everything else is just background.

<tip>
If you ever feel lost, just find the Composer. That's your home base. Everything happens there.
</tip>

## Ignoring the Scary Stuff

You might see:
- **Colorful text** — That's code with syntax highlighting. Ignore it.
- **Error messages** — We'll teach you how to handle these (it's easy!)
- **Terminal windows** — Technical output. You can close these.
- **Lots of files** — The AI manages them. You don't touch them.

**None of this is your job.** Your job is to tell the AI what to build. That's it.

## A Helpful Mindset

Think of Cursor like being the owner of a construction company:

- You don't lay the bricks (write code)
- You don't read the blueprints (understand the files)
- You don't operate the machinery (use the technical features)

You just tell the crew what to build, and they handle everything else.

<info>
The CEO of a tech company doesn't need to code. They need to communicate vision. That's your role here—communicating what you want built.
</info>

## The Composer is Your Friend

The Composer is just a chat window. You type (or speak with DeepFlo.App) what you want, and the AI responds by building it.

That's the entire relationship:
1. You describe what you want
2. The AI builds it
3. You review and request changes
4. Repeat until perfect

## Let's Build Something!

In the next lesson, we'll create your very first project using just your words. No technical knowledge needed—just your imagination.

# Creating Your First Project

Let's create something real in the next few minutes. This is where the magic happens!

## Step 1: Start a New Project in Cursor

When you open Cursor:
1. Look for "New Project" or "Open Folder"
2. Create a new empty folder on your computer (call it something like "my-first-site")
3. Open that folder in Cursor

Don't worry if this feels a bit technical—it's the only setup step you'll need to do.

## Step 2: Open the Composer

Find and open the Composer panel. This is where you'll talk to the AI.

## Step 3: Tell It What You Want

Here's your first prompt. You can type it, or even better, use DeepFlo.App to speak it:

> "Create a simple landing page for a coffee shop called 'Morning Brew'. Include a welcoming hero section with a warm headline, a section showing 3 popular drinks with images, and a contact section with the address and hours. Make it feel cozy and inviting."

Press Enter and watch what happens!

<tip>
Using DeepFlo.App? Just activate it and speak naturally, like you're describing the website to a friend. Your natural voice makes better prompts than carefully typed text.
</tip>

## Step 4: Watch the AI Work

The AI will start creating files and writing code. You'll see text appearing, files being created, and things happening in the background.

**You don't need to understand any of it.** Just let it work.

It's like watching a chef in a kitchen—you don't need to know the recipe to enjoy the meal.

## Step 5: See Your Creation

Once the AI is done, it will tell you how to see your new page. This might involve clicking a preview button or opening a link.

**You just built a website. With words.**

<info>
What used to take weeks of learning and days of work just happened in minutes. This is the power of AI-assisted building.
</info>

## What Just Happened?

You gave the AI a clear description, and it:
- Created all the necessary files
- Wrote all the code
- Designed the layout
- Added styling to make it look good

All from one message!

## Try Changing It

Now let's make a change. Type or speak:

> "Change the color scheme to use dark green and cream colors. Also make the headline bigger."

The AI will modify your creation. You can keep iterating like this forever.

## The Power of Your Voice

Notice how natural it felt to describe what you wanted? 

When you use DeepFlo.App, you can just talk:

*"Actually, let's add a section for customer reviews. Put it between the drinks and the contact info. Show three reviews with star ratings and customer names."*

Speaking your ideas flows naturally. The AI understands conversational language perfectly.

## You're a Builder Now

Congratulations! You've just built your first website using AI. In the next lessons, we'll dive deeper into how to communicate even more effectively with the AI.

# The Art of Asking

The quality of what you build depends on the quality of your prompts. Let's learn how to ask for exactly what you want.

## The Simple Formula

Great prompts follow a simple pattern:

**What** + **Details** + **Context**

- **What**: The thing you want built
- **Details**: Specific features or requirements
- **Context**: Style, mood, or purpose

## Examples: Bad vs Good

**Bad prompt:**
> "Make a website"

**Good prompt:**
> "Create a website for a yoga studio. It should have a calming, minimal design with lots of white space. Include a schedule of classes, instructor bios, and a booking form."

See the difference? The good prompt tells the AI:
- What kind of business (yoga studio)
- The design style (calming, minimal, white space)
- What sections to include (schedule, bios, booking)

<tip>
You don't have to get it perfect the first time. Start with something basic and add details in follow-up messages.
</tip>

## The Power of "Like"

One of the most useful words in prompting is "like":

> "Make it look like Apple's website"

> "Design it like a modern fintech app"

> "Style it like a luxury brand"

The AI understands these references and can match that aesthetic.

## Being Specific About Details

When you want something specific, say it clearly:

**Colors:**
> "Use a dark blue as the primary color with gold accents"

**Layout:**
> "Put the navigation at the top, hero section should take up the full screen"

**Content:**
> "The headline should say 'Transform Your Morning Routine'"

## When to Be Vague vs Specific

**Be vague when:**
- You want the AI to be creative
- You're not sure what you want yet
- You want to see options

**Be specific when:**
- You have a clear vision
- You're matching a brand or style
- You need exact text or colors

## Speaking Your Prompts

Here's a secret: when you speak your prompts using DeepFlo.App, they naturally become better.

Instead of typing short, choppy sentences, you'll say things like:

*"I want a landing page for my consulting business, and I want it to feel really professional and trustworthy, kind of like how McKinsey or Deloitte present themselves, with clean lines and maybe a dark blue color scheme..."*

That flowing description gives the AI so much more to work with than "make a professional consulting website."

<info>
Your natural speaking voice is your best prompting voice. Don't edit yourself—let your vision flow.

        duration: '5 min',
        content: `
# Building Through Iteration

Nobody gets it perfect on the first try. The real skill is knowing how to refine and improve through conversation.

## The Iteration Mindset

Think of building with AI like sculpting:
1. Start with a rough shape
2. Refine the details
3. Polish until it's right

You don't carve a masterpiece with one cut. You make many small adjustments.

## How to Give Feedback

When you see the result and want changes, be specific about what to fix:

**Instead of:**
> "I don't like it"

**Say:**
> "The header is too big. Make it smaller and move the logo to the left."

**Instead of:**
> "Make it better"

**Say:**
> "Add more spacing between sections and use a lighter shade of blue."

<warning>
Vague feedback leads to vague changes. The more specific you are about what's wrong, the faster the AI can fix it.
</warning>

## Magic Phrases That Work

These phrases are incredibly useful when iterating:

**"Keep everything else the same, but..."**
> "Keep everything else the same, but change the button color to green"

**"In the [section], change..."**
> "In the pricing section, change the middle plan to be highlighted"

**"Add [thing] below/above [place]"**
> "Add a testimonial quote below the hero section"

**"Remove..."**
> "Remove the third feature card"

**"Make [thing] more [adjective]"**
> "Make the headlines more bold and attention-grabbing"

## Building in Layers

A great approach is to build in layers:

**Layer 1: Structure**
> "Create a landing page with a hero, features, testimonials, and footer"

**Layer 2: Content**
> "Update the hero headline to say 'Build Your Dream Home'"

**Layer 3: Style**
> "Make the design more modern with rounded corners and soft shadows"

**Layer 4: Polish**
> "Add subtle animations when scrolling"

Each layer focuses on one aspect, making it easy to get exactly what you want.

<tip>
With DeepFlo.App, you can iterate lightning-fast. Just speak your feedback naturally: "Okay that header is way too big, can you shrink it down and add some padding on the sides? And actually make that button more of a coral color instead of red."
</tip>

## When to Start Over

Sometimes it's faster to start fresh than to fix something going wrong.

If you've made 5+ changes and it's still not right, try:
> "Let's start over. Create a new version with [clearer description]"

There's no shame in resetting. It's often the fastest path forward.

        duration: '7 min',
        content: `
# Bringing Your Vision to Life

You have an idea in your head. How do you get the AI to build exactly that? Let's master the art of description.

## Paint a Picture with Words

The AI can't see what's in your imagination. Your job is to paint a vivid picture with words.

**Weak description:**
> "Make a nice homepage"

**Vivid description:**
> "Create a homepage that feels like walking into a high-end boutique hotel. Clean lines, lots of breathing room, elegant typography. The color palette should be cream, charcoal, and touches of gold. Everything should feel intentional and luxurious."

The second description creates a clear mental image the AI can work with.

## Describe the Feeling

Sometimes describing the emotion is more powerful than describing the details:

> "This should feel exciting and energetic, like the countdown to a rocket launch"

> "The vibe should be cozy and welcoming, like your favorite coffee shop on a rainy day"

> "It needs to feel professional and trustworthy, like a top law firm"

<tip>
Don't worry about sounding "too creative." The AI understands emotional descriptions and translates them into design choices.
</tip>

## Reference What You Know

Use references the AI will understand:

**Brands:**
> "Style it like Airbnb's clean, friendly aesthetic"

**Industries:**
> "This should look like a premium SaaS dashboard"

**Places:**
> "The feel of a Scandinavian design studio"

## The Five Senses Trick

When describing a design, think about what you'd experience:

- **See**: Colors, shapes, spacing, imagery
- **Touch**: Does it feel premium? Playful? Solid?
- **Mood**: What emotion should visitors feel?
- **Movement**: Should it feel static or dynamic?

> "This website should feel like holding a well-crafted leather journal—premium, tactile, and thoughtful."

## Your Voice is Your Superpower

Here's something powerful: when people describe their vision out loud, they're naturally more expressive than when they type.

Try this with DeepFlo.App—instead of typing, just talk:

*"Okay so I'm imagining this website that just feels super clean and modern, like when you walk into an Apple store, you know? Lots of white space, beautiful product photos, and the text should be minimal but impactful. I want people to immediately feel like this is a premium brand they can trust..."*

That description just flowed naturally. It would have taken 3x longer to type, and you probably would have edited out the good parts!

<info>
Speak your vision like you're describing a dream to a friend. That natural, unfiltered description is exactly what the AI needs.

# Prompts That Always Work

Here are proven prompt templates you can use for common building tasks.

## Landing Pages

> "Create a landing page for [business/product]. The headline should communicate [main benefit]. Include sections for [list sections]. The design should feel [describe mood]. Use [color scheme] colors."

**Example:**
> "Create a landing page for an online fitness coaching service. The headline should communicate transformation. Include sections for hero, how it works, trainer intro, success stories, and pricing. The design should feel motivating and energetic. Use black, white, and orange."

## Forms and Signups

> "Add a [type] form that collects [fields]. When submitted, [what happens]. Style it to match the rest of the page."

**Example:**
> "Add a contact form that collects name, email, and message. When submitted, show a thank you message."

## Adding New Sections

> "Add a new section below [reference point] that shows [content]. Include [specific elements]."

**Example:**
> "Add a testimonials section below the features that shows 3 customer quotes with photos and names."

<tip>
Save your best prompts somewhere! When a prompt gives you great results, keep it as a template for future projects.
</tip>

## Changing Existing Elements

> "In the [location], change [element] to [new state]. Keep everything else the same."

**Example:**
> "In the hero section, change the background to a photo of mountains at sunset. Keep everything else the same."

## Complete Website Prompt

Here's a comprehensive prompt for a full website:

> "Create a complete website for [business]. 
> 
> It should include: [list sections]
> 
> The design should feel [mood/style]. 
> 
> Colors: [color palette]
> 
> The audience is [describe audience] and the main goal is [goal]."

## Speed Building with Voice

The fastest builders don't type these prompts—they speak them. With DeepFlo.App, you can describe an entire website in 30 seconds:

*"I need a website for my photography business. It should feel artistic and minimal, like a gallery. I want a homepage with a big hero image, a portfolio grid showing my best work, an about page with my story and a photo of me, and a contact page. Use black and white with maybe one accent color. The audience is high-end clients looking for wedding and event photography."*

That's a complete brief, delivered in seconds. No typing, no formatting, just natural speech.

The best prompt is the one you'll actually use. Keep it simple, keep it natural, and don't overthink it.

# Show, Don't Just Tell

Sometimes a picture really is worth a thousand words. Screenshots are one of your most powerful tools.

## Why Screenshots Work

When you drag a screenshot into the Composer, the AI can see exactly what you're looking at. It can understand:

- Designs you want to recreate
- Problems you need fixed
- Inspiration you want to match
- Errors that are confusing you

No more struggling to describe something in words. Just show it.

## How to Take Screenshots

**On Mac:**
- Cmd + Shift + 4 — Select an area to capture

**On Windows:**
- Windows + Shift + S — Select an area to capture

Once you have a screenshot, simply **drag and drop it into the Composer**.

<tip>
Take screenshots of just the part that matters. A focused screenshot of one section is more useful than an entire webpage.
</tip>

## When to Use Screenshots

**For inspiration:**
> [screenshot of a website you like]
> "Make my hero section look similar to this"

**For reference:**
> [screenshot of a design]
> "Build this exactly as shown"

**For problems:**
> [screenshot of something broken]
> "This doesn't look right. Can you fix it?"

## The Screenshot + Words Combo

The most effective approach combines a screenshot with context:

> [screenshot]
> "I love how this website uses cards for their pricing. Can you update my pricing section to use a similar card layout?"

The screenshot shows what you mean, and the words explain what you want.

## Build from Screenshots

Here's a powerful workflow:

1. Find a website or app you love
2. Screenshot the parts you like
3. Drag them into the Composer with instructions

> [screenshot of a navigation bar]
> "Create a navigation bar styled like this for my website"

You can build entire websites by combining your favorite parts from different sources!

<warning>
Screenshots are for inspiration and reference. Make sure you're creating something original, not copying someone else's work exactly.
</warning>

## Screenshot Everything

Get in the habit of screenshotting:
- Websites you admire
- Features you want to replicate

# Building from References

You don't need to start from scratch. Smart builders use references to get better results faster.

## Finding Good References

Where to find inspiration:

- **Dribbble.com** — Designer portfolios
- **Awwwards.com** — Award-winning websites
- **Your competitors** — See what works in your industry
- **Sites you admire** — Any website you think looks great

Browse, screenshot, and save the ones you like.

## How to Use References Effectively

**Don't say:**
> "Make it look exactly like this"

**Do say:**
> [screenshot]
> "I like the spacing and typography here. Apply a similar approach to my homepage, but keep my colors and content."

This gives you the essence of what works without copying.

<tip>
Focus on the principles, not the pixels. What makes that design work? The whitespace? The typography? Ask for those principles.
</tip>

## Combining Multiple References

You can use different references for different aspects:

> [screenshot 1]
> "I want my navigation styled like this"
> 
> [screenshot 2]
> "And my hero section laid out like this"
> 
> [screenshot 3]
> "With a color palette similar to this"

The AI can combine these references into something cohesive and unique.

## Before and After

A powerful technique is showing what you have vs what you want:

> [screenshot of your current version]
> "This is what I have"
> 
> [screenshot of what you want]
> "This is what I want. Can you update mine to match this style?"

## Reference by Description

No screenshot? You can reference well-known styles:

> "Style this like a Stripe landing page—clean, lots of whitespace, professional but friendly"

> "Make it feel like Apple's product pages—minimal, focused, beautiful imagery"

<info>
The more well-known the reference, the better the AI understands it. Apple, Airbnb, and Stripe are references most AI models understand deeply.
</info>

## Voice + Visuals Power Move

Here's an advanced technique: while looking at a reference, describe what you like about it using DeepFlo.App:

*"I really love how this hero section uses that big bold headline with the subtle gradient behind it, and the way the call-to-action button kind of floats there with plenty of space around it..."*

Drag in the screenshot, and your spoken description gives the AI rich context. It's the fastest way to communicate design intent.

# When Things Look Wrong

Things won't always look perfect. That's okay. Screenshots help the AI understand and fix visual problems quickly.

## The Visual Fix Method

When something looks wrong:

1. **Screenshot the problem** — Capture exactly what you're seeing
2. **Drag it into the Composer** — Show the AI
3. **Describe what's wrong** — Explain the issue
4. **Let the AI fix it** — It will identify and solve the problem

## Examples of Visual Problems

**Layout issues:**
> [screenshot of broken layout]
> "The images are overlapping the text. Can you fix this?"

**Styling problems:**
> [screenshot of ugly section]
> "This section looks off. The spacing is weird and the colors don't match."

**Mobile issues:**
> [screenshot of mobile view]
> "This looks fine on desktop but it's messed up on mobile."

**Missing elements:**
> [screenshot showing gap]
> "There should be a button here but it's not showing up."

<tip>
Always describe what you expected vs what you got. "It should look like X but instead it looks like Y."
</tip>

## Comparing Before and After

If something changed unexpectedly:

> [screenshot of before]
> "It used to look like this"
> 
> [screenshot of after]
> "Now it looks like this. Can you fix it?"

## Pointing to Specific Areas

Be specific about where the problem is:

> [screenshot with the problem area visible]
> "See the gap between the header and the content? That shouldn't be there."

> [screenshot]
> "The button in the top right corner is the wrong color."

## Quick Voice Descriptions

When you spot something wrong, your natural reaction is to describe it. Use that!

With DeepFlo.App: *"Okay something's weird with this section—the text is all bunched up on the left side and there's this huge empty space on the right. It should be centered and balanced."*

Drop in a screenshot of the problem, and the AI has everything it needs.

<info>
Visual problems are usually the easiest to fix. A screenshot plus a simple description is almost always enough for the AI to solve it.

# Errors Are Your Friends

When something goes wrong, it might feel frustrating. But here's the secret: **errors are just messages that help the AI fix things faster.**

## You Don't Need to Understand Errors

When you see an error message, you might think: "I have no idea what this means."

**Good news: you don't need to understand it.** The AI does.

Your job is simple:
1. Copy the error (or screenshot it)
2. Paste it into the Composer
3. Ask the AI to fix it

That's it!

## The Copy-Paste Fix

Most errors can be fixed with this simple approach:

> I'm getting this error:
> 
> [paste the error message here]
> 
> Can you fix it?

The AI will read the error, understand what went wrong, and fix it.

<tip>
Include the full error message. The more information you give, the faster the AI can diagnose the problem.
</tip>

## Where Errors Appear

You might see errors in different places:

- **In a popup** — A message saying something went wrong
- **As a red screen** — Something significant broke
- **In the preview** — Visual issues or broken features
- **As red/yellow text** — Warnings or problems

All of these can be fixed the same way: show them to the AI.

## Don't Panic!

When you see a wall of scary technical text, take a breath.

The AI has seen this exact error thousands of times. It knows what it means and how to fix it. Your only job is to deliver the message.

Think of yourself as a messenger. You don't need to understand the message—just deliver it to the AI.

<info>
The more errors you fix, the more confident you'll become. Soon, you'll see errors as minor speed bumps, not roadblocks.
</info>

        duration: '5 min',
        content: `
# A Simple Workflow for Any Error

Let's establish a reliable process for handling any error you encounter.

## Step 1: Capture the Error

When you see an error:

**If it's text:** Select all the error text and copy it (Cmd/Ctrl + C)

**If it's visual:** Take a screenshot

**If it's both:** Capture both!

## Step 2: Provide Context

When you paste the error into the Composer, add what you were trying to do:

> I was trying to [what you were doing] and got this error:
> 
> [paste error here]
> 
> Can you fix it?

**Example:**
> I was trying to add a contact form and got this error:
> 
> TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
> 
> Can you fix it?

The context helps the AI understand what you were attempting.

<tip>
"I was trying to..." is a magic phrase. It gives the AI the context it needs to not just fix the error, but get you to your goal.
</tip>

## Step 3: Let the AI Work

The AI will:
1. Analyze the error
2. Identify the cause
3. Propose a fix
4. Apply the changes

Just let it do its thing.

## Step 4: Verify the Fix

After the AI makes changes:
1. Check if the error is gone
2. Test that everything works
3. Make sure nothing else broke

## Step 5: Repeat if Needed

Sometimes one fix leads to another error. That's normal!

Just repeat the process. Each round gets you closer to a working solution.

## The Quick Fix Pattern

For rapid error fixing:

> [paste error]
> 
> Fix this please.

Short, direct, effective. The AI knows what to do.

## Voice Error Reporting

When you hit an error, you might naturally say: *"Ugh, I was just trying to add a button and now the whole thing is broken..."*

That's actually useful! With DeepFlo.App, capture that reaction, paste the error, and you have a complete problem report in seconds.

<info>
The average error takes less than a minute to fix. Don't let errors slow you down—they're just part of building.

# Problems You'll See (And How to Handle Them)

Let's look at common problems and how to communicate them to the AI.

## "Something Looks Wrong"

When something visual isn't right:

> [screenshot]
> 
> This doesn't look right. The [describe what's wrong]. Can you fix it?

## "It's Not Doing What I Asked"

When the feature doesn't work as expected:

> I asked for [what you requested] but instead [what's happening]. 
> 
> Can you fix it so that [describe expected behavior]?

<tip>
Be clear about what you expected and what you got. The gap tells the AI exactly what to fix.
</tip>

## "Everything Broke"

When the whole page crashes:

> [screenshot or error message]
> 
> The page stopped working after [last thing you did]. 
> 
> Can you undo that and try a different approach?

## "It Works on Desktop But Not Mobile"

For responsive issues:

> [screenshot of mobile view]
> 
> The desktop version looks good but on mobile [describe the problem]. 
> 
> Can you make it work on both?

## "I'm Not Sure What Went Wrong"

When you're truly lost:

> Something isn't working but I'm not sure what.
> 
> Here's what I see: [screenshot]
> Here's what I expected: [description]
> 
> Can you figure out what's wrong?

<warning>
If you're stuck in a loop where fixes create new problems, try: "Let's step back. Here's what I'm trying to achieve: [goal]. Can you rebuild this section from scratch?"
</warning>

## The "It's Still Not Working" Approach

If the AI tries to fix something but it's still broken:

> The fix didn't work. I'm still seeing the same issue:
> 
> [screenshot or error]
> 
> Can you try a different approach?

## Building Confidence

Every error you handle makes you better at building. You'll start recognizing patterns:

- Layout errors? Usually spacing or sizing
- Not working? Action isn't connected properly
- Looks different on mobile? Responsive settings need adjusting

You'll anticipate solutions—but you'll never need to implement them yourself. That's the AI's job.

<info>
Every error you encounter and fix makes you a better builder. Think of them as learning opportunities, not failures.

# Your Complete Building Workflow

You now have all the skills you need. Let's put them together into a workflow you can use for any project.

## The 5-Step Process

### Step 1: Describe Your Vision
Start by telling the Composer what you want:
> "Create a [type of thing] for [purpose]. It should [main features]. The style should be [look and feel]."

### Step 2: Review and Refine
Look at what the AI created, then guide it:
> "This is good. Now change [specific thing] and add [missing element]."

### Step 3: Use Screenshots
When words aren't enough, show it:
> [screenshot]
> "Make this section look more like this"

### Step 4: Fix Any Issues
When problems appear, solve them:
> [error or screenshot]
> "This isn't working. Can you fix it?"

### Step 5: Polish and Complete
Once the basics work, refine:
> "Add some nice touches—subtle animations, better spacing, make sure it looks great on mobile."

<tip>
This workflow works for everything—landing pages, apps, forms, anything. The steps are always the same; only the details change.
</tip>

## Speed is Your Friend

The faster you can iterate, the better your results:

- **Speak your prompts** with DeepFlo.App (4-5x faster than typing)
- **Screenshot liberally** instead of describing visually
- **Accept imperfect first drafts** and refine from there

## The Mindset Shift

**Traditional building:** Spend 90% of time building, 10% directing

**AI building:** Spend 10% directing, 90% letting AI build

Your job is to know what you want and clearly communicate it. The AI handles everything else.

<info>
You're not learning to code. You're learning to direct. That's a completely different—and much more accessible—skill.

# Pro Tips from Experienced Builders

Here are the secrets that separate beginners from power users.

## Tip 1: Save Your Best Prompts

When a prompt gives you great results, save it. Build a collection of prompts that work.

Create a simple document with categories:
- Landing page prompts
- Form prompts
- Problem-fixing prompts

## Tip 2: Build a Screenshot Library

Save screenshots of:
- Designs you love
- Layouts that work
- Color palettes that catch your eye

When starting a new project, browse your library first.

<tip>
Organize by category: /references/hero-sections, /references/navigation, /references/colors
</tip>

## Tip 3: Voice > Typing

This is the biggest speed multiplier. Speaking with DeepFlo.App is 4-5x faster than typing, and your prompts come out more natural and detailed.

Instead of typing for 2 minutes, speak for 20 seconds. The results are often better because you describe things more completely when talking.

## Tip 4: One Thing at a Time

Don't try to fix 5 things in one message. Do one thing, verify it works, then move to the next.

## Tip 5: Learn to Restart

If something is taking too long to fix, start that section fresh:

> "Let's delete this section and rebuild it. I want [clearer description]."

Sometimes rebuilding is faster than repairing.

<warning>
Don't be precious about things you can't see. If it's not working, delete it and try again.
</warning>

## Tip 6: Use "Keep Everything Else"

When you want one small change:

> "Keep everything else exactly the same, but change the button color to blue."

This prevents unintended changes.

## The Ultimate Tip

**Build every day.** Even just 15 minutes. The more you practice, the better you get.

## What's Next?

You now have everything you need:

✅ How to communicate with the Composer

✅ How to ask the right questions

✅ How to use screenshots and references

✅ How to fix errors confidently

✅ The complete building workflow

✅ DeepFlo.App for 4-5x faster prompting

Now go build something amazing! 🚀
